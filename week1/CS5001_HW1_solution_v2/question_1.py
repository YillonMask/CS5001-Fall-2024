1. Introduction to Python Statements

Write a Python program that displays the following sentences in the terminal:
Hello, World!
Python is a powerful and easy-to-learn programming language.

Hint: Use the print() function to display statements.
"""

print("Hello, World!")
print("Python is a powerful and easy-to-learn programming language.")

"""
Alternatively, you can combine the two statements into a single print() function call by using the newline character '\n' to separate the sentences:
"""
print("Hello, World!\nPython is a powerful and easy-to-learn programming language.")
